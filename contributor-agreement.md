2. Treatment of Account

You will receive one or more sets of Unitex/GramLab project access credentials,
and/or one or more sets of credentials you already have will be given the power
to access an Unitex/GramLab Repository. You will not allow anyone else to use
these credentials to access any Unitex/GramLab system. Should You become aware
of any such use, You will immediately notify the Unitex/GramLab Project sending
a message to unitex-devel{at}univ-mlv.fr; until such notice is received You will be
presumed to have taken all actions made using Your credentials. The Unitex/GramLab
Project and their designates will have complete control and discretion over
capabilities associated with Your credentials and may change them for any reason
at any time. Your name and email address, or a derivative of it, may be attached
to your contributions and so be visible worldwide via the Internet.

3. License Terms

Code committed by you to an Unitex/GramLab Repository, whether written by you or
a third party, must be governed by a license or set of licenses acceptable to the
Unitex/GramLab Project for the Code in question. Other licenses are not acceptable

licensing text.

By contributing Code, You confirm that, to the best of Your knowledge, the Code
does not violate the rights of any person or entity. If You contribute Code on

that employer has authorized the inclusion of such Code in an Unitex/GramLab
Repository under the terms of this agreement.

You, provided that:

a) The checkin comment contains information (or references to information)
sufficient to identify the author of the Code, the license of the Code, and the
third-party public source code repository the code was taken from, if it came
from such a repository; and
