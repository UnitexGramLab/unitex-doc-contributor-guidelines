# Code of Conduct Reporting Guide

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report
it to the Unitex/GramLab's Code of Conduct Committee by emailing
[conduct@unitexgramlab.org](mailto:conduct@unitexgramlab.org).
**All reports will be kept confidential.** In some cases we may determine that
a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of
all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals
instruct us otherwise.

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law
enforcement first.** If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate,
please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

In your report please include:

- Your `contact info` (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up).
- `Names` (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.
  If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
- `When` and `where` the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
- Your account of `what` occurred. If there is a publicly available record
  (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public forum thread) please include a link.
  Screenshots can be useful in the case something is edited or deleted before
  action is taken.
- Any `extra context` you believe existed for the incident.
- If you believe this incident `is ongoing`.
- Any `other information` you believe we should have.

## What happens after you file a report?

Reports will receive urgent and immediate attention from the Code of Conduct
Committee. Please refer to the [Enforcement Manual](pages/06.codes/01.code-of-conduct/04.enforcement)
for the complete information on how reports will be processed. Though normally
considered an internal document, it has been published in full in the interest
of transparency.

## Appealing

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision
of the committee, contact the Unitex/GramLab Board Chair at
[chair@unitexgramlab.org](mailto:unitexgramlab.org) with your appeal and it
will be review.
